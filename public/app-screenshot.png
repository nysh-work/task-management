This is a placeholder for the app screenshot mentioned in the README.md file.

To add a real screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of your application running in a browser
2. Save it as "app-screenshot.png"
3. Replace this file with your screenshot

The screenshot should show the main view of the application, ideally showing both task management features and the calendar view.
